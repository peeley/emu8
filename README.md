# emu8
This project is an emulator for the CHIP-8 architecture and assembly language written in C++ with the help of the SDL2 library.
The emulator is fully compatible and feature-complete with all included ROMs, although the ROMS themselves are not guaranteed to be bug-free.
The emulator itself, as an interpreter of the RISC CHIP-8 language was fun to implement and helped me personally gain a greater understanding of assembly language as a whole,
and how the hardware of a computer interacts with the machine code at its most bare-metal level.
